# 🧠 AI Meal Planner App 🍽️

The **AI Meal Planner** is a smart dietary planning application that creates personalized meal plans based on your age, weight, gender, and dietary preference (vegan, vegetarian, non-vegetarian). It calculates your BMR, optimizes meals using the knapsack algorithm, and generates creative descriptions using **LLaMA 3 (Groq API)**.
